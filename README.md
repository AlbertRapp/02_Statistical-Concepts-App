# Statistical Concepts App

An app to explore some statistical concepts. 
For now, one can explore

- variance of an estimator 
- the mechanism behind kernel density estimators
- confidence intervals

I am not a highly experience Shiny programmer (yet), so the code is probably less than optimal.
The next update will have to modularize the code as my code is currently too messy.
Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
