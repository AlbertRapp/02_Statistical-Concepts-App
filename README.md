# Statistical Concepts App

An app to explore some statistical concepts. 
For now, one can explore variance of an estimator and the mechanism behind kernel density estimators. 
I am not a highly experience Shiny programmer (yet), so the code is probably less than optimal.
Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
